# Minesweeper

Because the world has a great need of minesweeper clones.

Instructions:

 * Press smiley to restart; restarting resets the positions of the mines. 
 * Use dropdown list to set the level size.
 * Enter the number and press "Set" to change the amount of mines.
 * "Tweak Mines" allows you to move the mines around. Pressing smiley will delete your efforts, however.
 * "Export Level" downloads current level as a JSON file.
